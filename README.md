# Purpose

Facebook and Twitter have proven they are unworthy of the power they have acquired. They have centralized control over the modern digital public square and they have used this control to censor and deperson individuals online in addition to exploiting their users' privacy. This is unacceptable. The goal of this project is to provide a decentralized social network that will allow anyone that can install the open source software provided by this project to run a social network that will interoperate with other social networks running the same software. You can think of it as Email 2.0. Just as anyone can setup an email server and connect email clients to the server to send messages to other email servers so will a person or organization be able to setup a social network server and send message to other social network servers with a social network client. 

## Guiding Principles

1. Freedom Speech 
2. Decentralization
3. Open Source


# High Level Architecture:

Poseidon - Social network server
 - handles sending and receiving messages between users

Trident - Social network GUI client 
 - provides the UI for users to send messages

Zues - GUI admin client
 - provides the UI that allows an administrator to manage the server


# Roadmap (this will change):

1. Prototype server and client
    1. Create accounts

    3. Follow other users
2. Alpha server and client
    1. Reactions and replies
3. Beta server and client
    1. Private direct messages to one or many users
4. 1.0 server and client
